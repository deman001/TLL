# Tool Lending Library

## Overview

The Tool Lending Library (TLL) is a web application designed to create a sharing economy platform where users can lend and borrow tools within their community. The application aims to promote sustainability, reduce waste, and foster a sense of community among users.

## Summary

MERN based web application, that mimics social media platform with a twist of location limitation. Allowing for neighbors to share with each other. The TLL web application will be built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js and MongoDB for the backend. We will utilize frameworks and libraries like Express, Material UI, and others to ensure a robust, user-friendly, and efficient application.


## Specifications
1. Application should be built using NodeJS or any framework dependent on NodeJS as a backend programming language
2. Host on Heroku hosting server
3. Profiling: You must design and implement a set of features representing user profiles. Using the profiling features, users can update their personal information, and can see the profile of other users.
4. User Authentication and Authorization: Your system must authenticate users based on passwords . Your application also needs to support at least one 3rd party authentication such as Google/Facebook/Github sign-in, or two-factor authentication. Users have different roles in your system, and you must authorize them when they are conducting certain tasks. For instance, a normal user cannot change the password of other users, or update someone elseâ€™s personal information. Don't do this yourself, 
5. Rating and Commenting: When users use a shared resource provided by another user, they must be able to rate and comment on that offering. Using this commenting and rating features, others can decide whether to use that resource or not. For example, on AirBNB, a guest can review the host and the place. Others will read reviews and decide whether to rent that place or not.
6. Database: obviously the system will have to maintain a database to store information. You must use MongoDB.
7. Social Network: In any sharing economy platform, we will have a social network. In such networks, users can interact with one another, for example, then have chat session or share information.
8. Search and Recommendation System: Your system can provide the basic functionalities to search the shared economy. Using this feature, users should be able to search and discover what they want to use. Moreover, using the same recommendation system, the system should show similar things when a user is browsing a certain item. For instance, when one is looking at a room on AirBNB, the system lists similar properties on the same page. 
9. Admin: You should provide basic admin functionalities, including but not limited to changing passwords, updating and deleting information, and initializing/repopulating the database. 
10. Chatroom: Users can view and send messages in real-time using socket technology.
